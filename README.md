# react-hook-videojs

Due to how video.js mutates the DOM, integrating video.js with React can be a bit tricky. Especially if you want to support video.js component updates and correctly dispose of any old player.

React Hooks helps us package this quite nicely, and all you have to do to use this package is:

```
import React from "react";
import "video.js/dist/video-js.css";
import { useVideoJSÂ } from "react-hook-videojs";

const App = () => {
  const videoUrl = "http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4";
  const { Video, player, ready } = useVideoJS({ sources: [{ src: videoUrl }] });
  if (ready) {
      // Do something with the video.js player object.
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Video />
    </div>
  );
};
```

`useVideoJS` takes a single options argument, and passes it without modifications to video.js. See their [options reference](https://docs.videojs.com/tutorial-options.html) for further information.
